CS 250 Final Project - Sprint Review and Retrospective
Overview

This repository includes my Retrospective and Review of the Sprint for the CS 250 Final Project. This project delivered an application of Agile and Scrum software development methodologies; it paid particular attention to the principles of progress in small increments, teamwork, and the use of frequent user feedback to guide necessary adjustments. 
Sprint Review and Retrospective
The document detailing the way Agile methodologies were implemented in the SNHU Travel project is called the Sprint Review and Retrospective. It talks about the Scrum team and its various roles, the user stories that were generated for the team to use, and the way the team adapted to changes along the way. It gets into the nitty-gritty of communicating for collaboration, using organizational tools, and the overall effectiveness of the Agile process.

Essential Questions
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To grasp user requirements necessitates active engagement with the stakeholders and iterative feedback. Thus, the following three elements are crucial for the success of highly interactive Web projects:

1. User research
2. Stakeholder engagement
3. Rigorous iteration

These allow us to create user stories that break down the complex requirements of the project into manageable tasks.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Development is something that I do with an Agile mindset. For me, that means maintaining flexibility, making iterative progress, and collaborating closely with my team. The Agile methodology is what I plan to use when working on future projects. Among its many virtues, Agile enables development teams to work better and make better software.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Clear communication, active collaboration, and accountability are essential for good team membership. In the SNHU Travel project, everyone was kept aligned and blockers were addressed by the use of daily stand-ups. Tracking tasks and maintaining transparency were facilitated by using Jira. These are all signs of effective teamwork, which is the way to smoother development cycles and a higher-quality product.

This project shows my ability to apply Agile principles in a real-world scenario. It reinforces my skills in software development methodologies. 

The element of the project that demonstrates Agile principles is the way in which I broke the project down. I took the entire project and broke it into parts.
